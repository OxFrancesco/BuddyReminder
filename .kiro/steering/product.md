# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
BuddyReminder is a cross-platform mobile app that enables instant capture of notes, reminders, and AI-powered tasks. The core differentiator is "capture instantly" + "delegate tasks to an agent automatically" - users can capture something in under 3 seconds and have AI agents execute tasks in remote development workspaces.

## Target Users
**Primary**: Power users and professionals who need rapid task capture and delegation
- **Busy Individuals**: Need rapid capture, reminders, recurring chores
- **Builders/Operators**: Want to offload small tasks to AI agents (draft emails, research, code changes, file transforms)
- **On-the-go Users**: Use wearables for hands-free task capture and triage

## Key Features
### Core Functionality
- **Quick Capture**: Notes, reminders, and agent tasks in <3 seconds
- **Smart Reminders**: Time/location-based notifications with snooze/reschedule
- **AI Agent Tasks**: Delegate structured tasks to OpenCode agents in Daytona workspaces
- **Cross-Platform**: iOS, Android, and WearOS support

### Key Differentiators
- Lock screen widgets and shortcuts for instant access
- Agent task execution with safety controls and approval gates
- Unified inbox for notes/reminders/tasks with clear type distinction
- Real-time agent execution results with artifacts and summaries

## Business Objectives
- **User Adoption**: High retention through instant capture UX (D1/D7/D30 metrics)
- **Task Completion**: High agent task success and usefulness rates
- **Platform Integration**: Deep iOS/Android integration for seamless workflows
- **Safety & Trust**: Transparent agent operations with audit logs and user control
